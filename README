                  vc - count the vowels in a text file

USAGE

  usage: vc [file]

  vc will read from standard input if no input file is specified.

BACKGROUND

  A few months ago, an interviewer asked me to sketch up a way to count
  the number of vowels in an input file.

  Weeks later, I decided to go ahead and actually implement it.
  vc (i.e. "vowel count"), is the result.

  My idea essentially was to have an alphabet file that the program
  would read to determine what a "vowel" was, and then plow through the
  input file, character by character, incrementing its count as it went.

  The implementation currently just uses a lookup table because it's a
  bit faster.

ISSUES

  Currently only supports ASCII input.

BUILDING

  To build it, just run `make'.

SEE ALSO

  Naturally, after spending an hour or two putting this together, I
  realized that one could very easily use `grep' to achieve the same
  result.  To see this, try

    $ cat input_file | grep -e "[aeiou]" -o -i | wc -l

  Oh well.  For really large inputs my program is faster.
