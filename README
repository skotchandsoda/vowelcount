                  vc - count the vowels in a text file

  usage: vc [file]

About

  I interviewing for a software engineering internship, and for warmup
  the interviewer asked me to sketch up a way to count the number of
  vowels in an input file.

  Weeks later, bored, I decided to implement the idea I had sketched in
  the interview.

  vc, i.e. vowel count, is the result of my efforts.

  My idea essentially was to have an alphabet file that the program
  would read to determine what a "vowel" was, and then plow through the
  input file, character by character, incrementing its count as it went.

Issues

  As of this writing I do not support an alphabet file.

  vc currently only supports ASCII input.

Build

  To build it, just run `make'.

  Naturally, my effort was pretty much totally in vain, as one could
  very easily use `grep' to achieve the same result.  To see this, try

    $ cat input_file | grep -e "[aeiou]" -o -i | wc -l

  in Linux, OS X, or any other remotely POSIX-compliant environment.
